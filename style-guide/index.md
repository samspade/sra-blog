# Solicitors Regulation Authority Style Guide

This guide covers rules and practices on our style, spelling and grammar. It is arranged alphabetically. It includes guidance on specific points of style, for example, abbreviations and numbers.

## abbreviations and acronyms – shortened forms of words or lengthy phrases

The first time you use an abbreviation or an acronym in a document, write it out in full and put the abbreviation or acronym in brackets afterwards. From then on, refer to it by the abbreviation only. For example:

✔ the Legal Services Board (LSB), then the LSB. Do not:

✘ use full stops in abbreviations – LSB, not L.S.B
✘ use an acronym (eg LSB) if you are not going to use it again later in the document
✘ write out the acronym in full if it is generally understood by its name in acronym form – for example, BBC or NHS.

### acronyms in headings and subheadings

Try to avoid using acronyms in headings and subheadings. If something is abbreviated into acronym form before a heading or subheading, still write it out in full in the heading or subheading without the acronym. Then, continue to write it in acronym form.

## ampersand &

Use ‘and’ rather than ‘&’. When referring to a law firm and it has an ampersand in its name, you can use it. For example, Solicitors & Co.

## apostrophes ’ – dates

Usually, dates do not use apostrophes (for example, 1900s) unless the century is omitted (for example, the England squad of '66 or songs from the ‘80s).
apostrophes – its and it’s

---

### it’s

It’s is a contraction of it is. Use it’s when you want to shorten it is, for example: ‘It’s a nice day.’ The apostrophe replaces the missing ‘i’.

### its

There is no apostrophe in the possessive ‘its’, for example: the government has confirmed __its__ policy position.

## apostrophes – to show someone owns something

Apostrophes are also used to show that someone or something owns something. For example:

- Where there is one subject (highlighted) and the word does not end with an ‘s’:

  the accountant’s report, the law firm’s service, in one week’s time. An apostrophe and an ‘s’ are added.

- Where there is one subject (highlighted) but it ends in an ‘s’:

  the bus’s timetable, the walrus’s tusks. An apostrophe and an ‘s’ are added.

- Where the subject is plural (highlighted), meaning there is more than one of them:

  the accountants’ report, law firms’ service, in two weeks’ time. Only an apostrophe is added.

- Where the subject is plural (highlighted), but it’s irregular, meaning you do not need to add an ‘s’ to make it plural:

  the Women’s Network, the children’s books, the men’s race. An apostrophe and an ‘s’ are added.

### apostrophes – to show when a proper noun (meaning a person or a place) owns something

  Here, add an apostrophe and an ‘s’ to names already ending in an ‘s’ if you would naturally pronounce the extra ‘s’. This will be the case in most circumstances. For example:

- Miles __’s__ speech
- Dickens __’s__ novels
- Paris __’s__ monuments.

  Add only an apostrophe if you do not naturally pronounce the extra ‘s’.

  This will be in very rare instances. For example: Tobias Menzies__’__ royal accent in the television show, The Crown.

  If the name is plural and ends in an ‘s’, you only need to add an apostrophe, for example:

- the Suttons __’__ home
- the Klingons __’__ attack
- the Chars __’__ holiday.

## black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME)

  All written in lower case apart from Asian.

## bullet points

  Where the bullet points are part of what would otherwise be a long sentence:

- write with a colon (:) before the bullet points
- make sure there is a break before the first bullet, either by entering a line break, or through automatic formatting (used in some of our templates)
- use lower case at the start of the bullet
- only include a full stop after the final bullet, not after each bullet point
- aim to keep bullet points short.

  Where your bullet points are complete, individual sentences, you can capitalise the first letter of the first word and add a full stop at the end of each one. For example:

- If you need your reader to do something, make it absolutely clear what that is and when they need to do it by up front.
- If you need them to understand some information, but they do not need to do anything, put the most important thing first.
- Think about how you want your reader to feel when they read your writing – comforted, acknowledged or informed?

## capitals – general use

  We avoid using capitals unnecessarily.

  We use title case (see entry below) when writing out the full names of publications, campaigns and events.

  We use capitals in people’s full job titles (see below) but not jobs.

  We cap down proper nouns when we refer to them in an abbreviated form. For example:

- in government or the government (Her Majesty’s Government is the official name)
- compensation fund or fund (the Solicitors Regulation Authority Compensation Fund)
- the strategy (Corporate Strategy).

### capitals – job titles

  Job titles are capitalised where they appear before the individual’s name or when we are specifically talking about a person in a particular role, for example:

- Prime Minister Boris Johnson
- Executive Director, External and Corporate Affairs, Jane Malcolm
- Anna Bradley, Chair of the SRA Board.

  When we are generally referencing a job, it does not have to be capitalised, for example:

- chief executives have a responsibility to lead an organisation
- solicitors should deliver a proper standard of service to clients
- executive directors have a joint responsibility.

### capitals – title case (capitalising the start of all words in a title)

  We use title case to write out the names of publications, campaigns and events. This is where you capitalise the first letter of every word. For example:

- ### Risk Outlook
- ### Question of Trust
- ### Looking to the Future.

  Unless they are the first word in the sentence, you do not need to capitalise:

- articles – a, an and the
- coordinating conjunctions – and, but, or, for and nor
- prepositions – as, at, by, for, in, of, on, per, and to.

  For example:

- Trust and the Market
- Of Mice and Men
- Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.

## commas ,

### For use in a list

  Use commas to separate words or phrases in a list. For example:

- The animals in the zoo included zebras, elephants, lions and birds.

  Commas are not normally used after the second-to-last last item in a list, unless it is necessary for clarification and to avoid confusion. For example:

- The teams involved included Legal and Enforcement, Investigation and Supervision, and External and Corporate Affairs.

### Bringing two sentences together

  Use a comma to bring two separate sentences together. For example:

- __Before: The Wizard of Oz is one of the most famous films of all time. It has been seen by millions of people worldwide.__
- __After: The Wizard of Oz is one of the most famous films of all time, and it has been seen by millions of people worldwide.__

  As well as a comma, you will need a conjunction (a word used to connect two parts of a sentence), such as but, and, yet, or, because, nor, although, since, unless, while, and where. Another example:

- __Before: The Wizard of Oz is considered one of the best films of all time and was nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards. It lost to Gone with the Wind.__
- __After: The Wizard of Oz is considered one of the best films of all time and was nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards, but it lost to Gone with the Wind.__

### Isolating/interrupting commas

  You can use a pair of commas around a phrase to isolate text and interrupt the flow of a sentence. For example:

- __Before: The campus, although heavily signposted, was not always easy to navigate.__

  To make sure you are using these correctly, check whether the text still makes sense when you take out the pair of commas and text. For example:

- __After:The campus, although heavily signposted, was not always easy to navigate.__ 

  Be careful not to add in commas if they change the meaning of the sentence. For example:

  ✘ People in rural areas, who depend on a regular service, are up in arms over proposals to cut down the bus timetable.

  You cannot add the phrase and isolating commas in the sentence above as it would mean all people were up in arms over proposals to cut down bus services. In fact, it is only the people who depend on a regular service who are up in arms. The sentence should read:

  ✔ People in rural areas who depend on a regular service are up in arms over proposals to cut down the bus timetable.

  In some cases, you can also use a single comma to interrupt a sentence at the beginning or at the end. For example:

  ✔ Despite their best efforts, the team came in second place.

  ✔ The team came in second place, despite their best efforts.

  You can also create a pair of interrupting commas within this sentence:

  ✔ The team, despite their best efforts, came in second place.

  Generally, if you have a single interrupting comma, you should always be able to swap the two parts of the sentence and it still make sense. For example:

  ✔ He slept on the train, shortly before arriving in Paris.

  ✔ Shortly before arriving in Paris, he slept on the train.

  And, sometimes, you do not even need an interrupting comma if the sentence makes sense without it and you do not want to interrupt it:

  ✔ He slept on the train shortly before arriving in Paris.

## contractions (abbreviating words with an apostrophe)

  Apart from ‘it’s’, we do not allow contractions in formal writing – such as correspondence with the public, the profession and submissions we make to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal.

  We allow the following contractions in informal writing – such as on our website, our social media and informal staff communications:

- can't
- don't
- isn't
- it's
- let's
- we'll
- we're
- we've
- won't
- you're.

## coronavirus

  When writing about the virus, we use either:

- ‘coronavirus’, or
- ‘Covid-19’.

  Do not use the abbreviation ‘C19’ or use block capitals, such as ‘COVID-19’.

## correct spellings

### adviser

  Not ‘advisor’. This is the American spelling.

### among

  Not ‘amongst’.

### focus, focused, focusing

  One ‘s’.

### ise/ize

  Use ‘ise’, for example: organ__ise__, categor__ise__, real__ise__.

  ✔ ise

  ✘ ize

  The ‘ize’ spelling is American. Check that your spell checker language is set to English (UK).

### solicitor apprentice/solicitor apprenticeship

  No hyphen

### toolkit

  One word.

### while

  Not ‘whilst’.

## courts

  Generally, the names of courts or tribunals will use capital letters as they are proper nouns. However, there are some exceptions, particularly if you are not talking about a specific court in a specific location. For example:

- Edmonton County Court or county court
- Crown Court
- family court (or family division of the High Court)
- High Court
- Birmingham Magistrates’ Court or magistrates’ court
- Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal or tribunal
- Supreme Court
- youth court.

## dates

  We write out dates using the following style:

- 5 February 2007:

  ✔ use a digit

  ✔ write out the month in full (we allow exceptions in tables when months can be shortened, such as, Jan, Feb, Mar, etc)

  ✘ do not add ‘st’, ‘th’ or ‘nd’

  ✘ do not use any commas.

## entities – organisations and teams

  All organisations are singular. For example:

  ✔ You should write to the Legal Ombudsman. __It__ should be able to help you.

  ✔ The Bar Standards Board __is__ the regulator for barristers.

  ✔ In __its__ report, the government said __it__ was changing __its__ policy. This extends to the names of groups and directorates. For example:

  ✔ the team has changed __its__ name

  ✔ the Investigation and Supervision team has __its__ away day tomorrow

  ✔ Policy Committee __is__ considering the matter.

  There are words that appear to fall into this category but do not. For example, ‘police’ is always plural as no singular ‘police’ exists:

  ✔ The police are/A police force is/A police officer is…

  ✘ A police is…

## email

  One word, no hyphen.

## emails – signature and out of office templates

  We have templates for our email signatures and out of office templates. For ease, you can copy and paste these from our template library on Word if you:

- open a new Word document
- click ctrl + O
- click on ‘New’ on the left-hand side, which will show you a selection of templates, and then ‘Shared’
- scroll until you see ‘Email signature and out of office templates’.

  Everyone should be using our template in their email signature, which looks like the one below.

### Name

  Role

  Unit (if needed)

  Solicitors Regulation Authority

  [Insert your preferred contact number here if you have one (if not, leave this out).](http://www.sra.org.uk/) [sra.org.uk](http://www.sra.org.uk/)

## en dash –

  The en dash can be used to show range, for example:

- 13.00–15.00 (please note there are no spaces in between the digits and the en dash).

  When indicating range in running text, you can write the word ‘to’: the lunch will take place from 13.00 to 15.00.

  An en dash is also used to emphasise a point or to offer clarity in a sentence:

- The dog ran away from its owner – much to the owner’s sadness.
- You may think they lie – they do not.
- You will need to carry out a patch – where you update the programs on your computer – to fix the problem.

  To create an en dash, press the crtl, - and + keys on your number pad (this will not work on all systems). You can also insert it into your document through symbols.

## examples and explanations (eg, etc and ie)

  Try not to use ie and eg as they are not always reader friendly. You can use the following instead:

- eg – for example
- etc – and other things
- ie – namely.

  Some key rules:

- if you use eg, etc, or ie, do not include any full stops in between or at the end of the letters
- there is no need to use ‘eg’ and ‘etc’ in the same sentence
- try not to use them in formal writing
- do not use etc after only one item.

## font

  The font we use is Arial. Characters in Arial are easier for those with reading difficulties or a visual impairment to distinguish. Font size should always be 11pt minimum to make text as easy to read as possible.

## footnotes or endnotes – general use in reports and publications

  It is acceptable to use footnotes or endnotes, though there are advantages and disadvantages to both. You should choose one style for your document. Whichever you use, you should always use numbers as the reference, as these are most user friendly.

### Footnotes appear in the footer section and appear on the same page as the text they reference.

✔ Use these if you think it will be handy for your reader to immediately access the information they need at the bottom of the page.

✘ Do not use these if there are a lot of them, making the page look cluttered and distracting for the reader.

### Endnotes appear at the end of a document.

✔ Use these if you have numerous references and you think it will be neater to list them all in one place.

✘ It might be important for your reader to know, straightaway, what sources you are citing, in which case it would be better to use footnotes.

### footnotes and endnotes – styles

  How and where to use footnotes and endnotes:

- Insert a footnote or endnote when you need to add further explanation or a reference to your text, for example, when you use a direct quote or paraphrase or cite information.
- Always insert the footnote or end note character after the full stop.1
- In the footnote or endnote, remember to accurately quote your source. This could include the name of the person (first name, last name), organisation, the name of the publication, the year of publication, and the page number or paragraph at which the referenced information can be found. Use commas in between this information and add a full stop at the end. An example can be found in the footnotes below.2

## footers in emails

  To keep our email signatures uniform, we do not use any footers in emails or correspondence.

## full stop

  Leave a single space after full stops. We do not use double spacing in any documents.

## gender

  Use gender-neutral words wherever possible, for example:

  ✔ Solicitors should make sure that they keep an accurate record.

  ✔ In this case study, the solicitor took client money. They moved it into their own bank account.

  ✘ The solicitor should make sure that he keeps an accurate record.

  ✘ In this case study, the solicitor took client money. They moved it into his own bank account.

  1 This will be the case in the vast majority of cases, unless you are quoting or paraphrasing only a single word from another source.

  2 Legal Services Board, Annual Report and Accounts for the Year Ended 31 March 2018, 2018, page 9.

## hyphens

  We use hyphens when two or more words are joined together to change the description of a noun. For example:

- anti-money laundering
- three-year strategy
- high-spirited person.

You do not use hyphens after adverbs ending in ‘ly’, for example: ‘a hotly disputed proposal’.

## hyperlinks

Please see web addresses and hyperlinks.

italics
We only use italics to reference case law.

We do not use italics for emphasis or for titles. This is because italics are difficult for people with learning difficulties to read.

## judgment

Rather than ‘judgement’. We recognise that judgment is conventionally only used for legal judgments. To keep it simple, our style is to use judgment for all contexts.

## mySRA

Always lower case ‘my’.

## money (pence, thousands, m and bn)

We write our monetary values using the following style:

✔ 40 pence – do not add ‘pence’, unless the amount is lower than one pound.

✔ £70 – no full stop and no zeros if there is no pence figure.

✔ £70.73 – full stop and no ‘pence’.

✔ £1,000 – with a comma in between each set of a thousand (£1K is acceptable if the figure is in a table).

✔ £1m – using ‘m’, not writing ‘million’ out in full, no space in between the currency symbol and the figure and no full stop after the ‘m’.

✔ £2bn – no space in between the figure and the ‘bn’.

## numbers

### Fewer than zero

Always use a 0, decimal point and figures if the value is less than zero:

✔ 0.5

### One to nine

For numbers one to nine, spell them out, unless the number is used to indicate a percentage (see more under the percentages entry). For example:

✔ nine staff attended the meeting

### 10 and above

Write out numbers from 10 onwards as figures:

✔ 10 staff attended the meeting

### Numbers at the start of a sentence

If a number starts a sentence, it should always be written out in full:

✔ Thirty-four hula-hoops were found in the researcher’s filing cupboard.

To avoid this, you can reconstruct the sentence or add ‘some’ at the beginning of the sentence:

✔ Some 34 hula-hoops were found in the researcher’s filing cupboard.

## ordinal numbers (a number that tells you its position in a list)

Spell out ‘first’ to ‘ninth’. After that use 10th, 11th 12th, etc. Always use standard size font. This does not apply to dates.

## percentages

When we write out ‘per cent’ it is two separate words:

✔ 9 per cent of staff attended the meeting.

If a number starts a sentence, it should always be written out in full, even if it is a percentage. For example:

✔ Eighty-four per cent of staff responded to the survey (‘per cent’ is always used when the percentage has been written out.)

To avoid this, you can reconstruct the sentence:

✔ The number of staff responses to the survey was 84 per cent.

Use the symbol – % – in graphics and if the text repeatedly cites percentages.
personal titles

---

Where possible, mirror the title our customers use to address themselves – for example: Ms, Mr, Mrs, Miss, Ms and Dr. If you do not know their title, simply address them using their first and last names. Do not assume a title.

## practise/practice

Practice as a noun is spelt with a ‘c’. The verb is practise, spelt with an ‘s’. For example:

- They have four partners in the practice.
- A family solicitor will practise family law.
- They need to renew their practising certificates.

  A handy tip to remember the right one: ‘advice’ and ‘advise’ follow the same rule. Replace ‘practice’ or ‘practise’ with the advice equivalent and it should guide you to the correct spelling.

## proper nouns (names of people and places)

  Use proper nouns for:

- titles, for example: Mr, Mrs, Dr
- buildings, for example, The Cube
- place names, for example, London Bridge.

## quotations ‘’

  Use single quotation marks for speech, with a colon before the quotation marks. For example:

- Stephanie Palmer said: ‘The new regulatory approach brings greater flexibility.’

  In long passages of speech, use a quote mark at the start of each new paragraph, but close the quotes only at the end of the final paragraph.

  Use double quotations for quotations within quotations. For example:

- The solicitor said: ‘The new cybersecurity system is much more secure. One of my clients told me: “This gives me more confidence in the firm.”’

## RELs and RFLs and article (a, an, the) use

  When talking about regulated European lawyers and regulated foreign lawyers in their initialised form – REL and RFL – you should always use the pronoun ‘an’. For example: ‘An REL was practising…’.

## seasons

  Seasons are lower case, unless they are part of a title, such as: Your SRA, Summer, 2025.

## SRA number

  The way in which we refer to firms’ and individuals’ SRA numbers – not ‘SRA ID’, ‘SRA Number’ or ‘SRA ID number’, etc.

## there, their, they’re

- ‘Their’ is used to describe ownership: ‘their bag is caught in the lift.’
- ‘There’ is used to describe a place or to show something exists: ‘over there, by the lifts’ and ‘there is a problem we need to discuss.’
- ‘They’re’ is a contraction of ‘they are’: ‘they’re going into the lifts now.’

## time

  Use the 24-hour clock, with a full stop separating the hours and minutes, and an en dash between the times. There should be no spaces in between the en dash and the times. For example:

  SMT forum: 14.30–15.30. To create an en dash, press crtl and - on your keyboards number pad.

## underline

  We generally do not underline words, titles or use underline to emphasise what we are trying to say. This is because they are harder for people with learning difficulties to read. You can use bold instead.

## web

  Lower case, for example: web strategy.

## web addresses and hyperlinks

  We try to naturally embed hyperlinks into running text as the vast majority of our content is read on screen. For example:

✔ [The Principles and Codes are underpinned by our](https://www.sra.org.uk/sra/strategy/sub-strategies/sra-enforcement-strategy.page) [Enforcement](https://www.sra.org.uk/sra/strategy/sub-strategies/sra-enforcement-strategy.page) [Strategy.](https://www.sra.org.uk/sra/strategy/sub-strategies/sra-enforcement-strategy.page)

✘ The Principles and Codes are underpinned by our [Enforcement Strategy, which can be](https://www.sra.org.uk/sra/strategy/sub-strategies/sra-enforcement-strategy.page) [found on our](https://www.sra.org.uk/sra/strategy/sub-strategies/sra-enforcement-strategy.page) website.

✔  [Log into mySRA](https://www.sra.org.uk/mysra/mysra.page) to update your details.

✘  [Click here](https://www.sra.org.uk/mysra/mysra.page) to update your details on mySRA.

When you link to a webpage or write out the link in full, check to see if there is a short URL. For example:

✔ sra.org.uk/newregs

✘ sra.org.uk/solicitors/standards-regulations-resources/

  [You can email our Digital Communications team](mailto:digital@sra.org.uk) to see if a short link already exists or to ask if the team can create one for you.

  Remember:

- Hyperlinks and websites are always changing, so try to choose a hyperlink that takes you to a page on our website that is likely to stay the same.
- If you are sending your correspondence by post, you will need to signpost to the web address by writing out the URL and not by a hyperlink.
- Make the hyperlink as visible as possible by embedding it in more than one word. This makes it easier to see that there is a hyperlink and for the reader to click on it.

[If you write out a web address, write it without the ‘https:// and](http://www/) www.’ part:

✔ [sra.org.uk](http://www.sra.org.uk/).

✘ [http://www.sra.org.uk](http://www.sra.org.uk/)
